            his initial impulse to bury a shortsword in the fat man’s throat. A terrible mistake in hindsight. They had met
            inside his extravagant mansion, another mistake. Thren vowed to correct his carelessness in the coming months.
            He had tried to stop the war from erupting, but it appeared everyone in Veldaren desired chaos. If the city wants
            blood, it can have it, Thren thought. But it won’t be mine. “Are you in here, father?” he heard his elder son
            ask from an adjacent room. Thren held his anger in check. “And if I was not?” he asked. His son Randith entered
            from the other room. He looked much like his father, having the same sharp features, thin nose, and grim smile.
            His hair was brown like his mother’s, and that alone endeared him to Thren. They both wore the gray trousers
            and cloaks of their guild. A long rapier hung from one side of his belt, a dagger from the other. Randith’s blue
            eyes met his father’s. “Then I’d kill you,” Randith said, a cocky grin pulling up the left side of his face.
            “Where is the mage?” the guildmaster asked. “Connington’s men cut me with a toxin, and its effect is troublesome.”
            Troublesome hardly described it, but Thren wouldn’t let his son know that. His flight from the mansion was a
            blur in his memory. The toxin had numbed his arm and made his entire side sting with pain. His neck muscles had
            fired off at random, and one of his knees kept locking up during his run. He had felt like a cripple as he fled
            through the alleyways of Veldaren, but the moon was waning and the streets empty, so none had seen his pathetic
            stumbling. “Cregon isn’t here,” Randith said as he leaned toward his father’s exposed shoulder and examined the
            cut. “Then go find him,” Thren said. “And where is Senke? He was supposed to bring me word from Gemcroft.” “Maynard
